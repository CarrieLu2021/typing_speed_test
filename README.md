# typing_speed_test

This Typing Speed Test program is a Python application that allows users to measure their typing speed by presenting them with a series of random words that they need to type as quickly and accurately as possible within a given time limit. 

The program features a user-friendly graphical user interface built with the tkinter module, and the words used for the test are fetched from a publicly available word list. 

Once the user starts the test, a timer begins counting down, and the user's typing speed is calculated based on the number of words they have typed correctly within the time limit. The program displays the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM), and they can restart the test at any time to try and improve their score. Overall, the Typing Speed Test program is a useful tool for anyone looking to improve their typing speed and accuracy.
